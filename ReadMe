##Power BI Visualization
The Power BI visualization provides interactive dashboards and reports based on the analyzed dataset. It offers dynamic visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables to visually represent the findings from the SPSS analysis.

##New Columns in Power BI

Age Category: Created a new column categorizing age groups based on the "age" column.
Index Column: Created a new index column for easier tracking and reference.


##Here's an overview of the Power BI visualizations i've created:

Bar Chart for User by Age Category: This bar chart visualizes the distribution of users across different age categories.
Doughnut Chart for Gender Proportion: This doughnut chart illustrates the proportion of users by gender.
Line and Bar Chart for Profession and Income: This combination chart displays both the average income and the count of users by profession.
Average Time Spent by Interests: This chart shows the average time spent on the platform based on users' interests.
Doughnut Chart of Debt Proportion: This doughnut chart represents the proportion of users who are in debt.


##Slicers for Filtering:

Countries: Allows users to filter data based on countries.
Income Level: Enables filtering based on income levels.
Homeownership Status: Allows filtering based on whether users own a house or not.
Car Ownership Status: Enables filtering based on whether users own a car or not.
Age Category: Allows filtering based on age categories.
Gender: Enables filtering based on gender.
